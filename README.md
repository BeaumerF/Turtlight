# Turtlight
A redshift/f.lux-like software for Sailfish OS by Jolla

![demo](./icons/screen/turtlight.gif)

## What does it use?
  - Qt5
  - Sailfish SDK
  
## How does it work ?
Make your own filter by moving the sliders of blue reduction and alpha opacity.
Altering the color temperature to reduce the prominence of blue light at night will improve the effectiveness of sleep.

## Why this project ?
Interested in Mobile development, I consider it important to know all the OS. That's why I tried a first app for my Sailfish X. Because I'm a f.lux and redshift user, I thought that it could be nice to have it on my smartphone too.

## To do
- [X] Put the yellow filter on the app
- [ ] Put the yellow filter out of the app
- [ ] Schedule when you want turtlight activated
